block : this will take the full line of the html line
inline: this will take only the width of the element

convert the block into inline as using the display property as inline
and inline to block as the block

***********************div*************

# Grid concepts

 <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 100px 100px 100px;"> //  it will take 4 columns
  <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;">// this could take the balance space in the line apart from the 200px


# flex box

it just like a css grid , but more flexible
